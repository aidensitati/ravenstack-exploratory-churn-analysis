# Ravenstack Churn Analysis

## Research Question
Why do Ravenstack customers churn?

## Core Finding
Churn is not driven by isolated features.
It emerges from **behavioral trajectories** characterized by
engagement decay, friction accumulation, and failed recovery.

## Analytical Structure
The analysis progresses through:

1. Dataset consolidation
2. Leakage and temporal integrity enforcement
3. Target variable interrogation
4. Feature admissibility triage
5. Conditional signal variation
6. Conditional signal validation
7. Behavioral state modeling

## Behavioral Insight
Customers move through identifiable behavioral states
before churn. Once withdrawal behavior emerges,
recovery probability collapses.

## Output
- `consolidate_ravenstack_analysis.py` — full analytical pipeline
- Explicit behavioral state model
- Reproducible, reviewer-readable logic
